This project utilizes transactional data from a UK retailer to improve marketing strategies and increase sales through precise customer segmentation. We converted raw transactional data into a customer-focused dataset, engineered new features, and applied K-means clustering to discover distinct customer segments. By analyzing these segments' unique profiles and preferences, we created a recommendation system that suggests popular products to customers who haven't bought them yet. This personalized approach aims to enhance marketing efficiency, elevate customer satisfaction, and drive sales growth.

Key Steps:

Data Cleaning & Transformation:

Load and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, outliers, and anomalies.


Feature Engineering:

Create features such as total spending, purchase frequency, average transaction value, recency, and customer tenure.



Data Preprocessing:

Apply feature scaling and dimensionality reduction techniques.

Customer Segmentation:

Use the K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers and determine the optimal number of clusters.

Cluster Analysis & Evaluation:

Analyze and evaluate the clusters to understand customer characteristics and preferences.

Recommendation System:

Develop and implement an algorithm to recommend top-selling products to specific customer clusters.
